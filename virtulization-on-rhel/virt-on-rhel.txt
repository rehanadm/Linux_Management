###Install Virtualization Packages for Cockpit
Ensure that the necessary virtualization packages are installed on your system. For RHEL 8, you need both the Cockpit Virtual Machines package and the libvirt package for managing virtual machines.

1.Install the required packages:
# Install Cockpit Virtual Machines (if not already installed)
sudo yum install cockpit-machines

# Install the necessary virtualization packages for managing VMs
sudo yum install qemu-kvm libvirt virt-install bridge-utils

# Install the Cockpit libvirt integration
sudo yum install cockpit-libvirt

### Once the packages are installed, restart Cockpit and libvirt services:

# Restart Cockpit service
sudo systemctl restart cockpit

# Restart libvirt service
sudo systemctl restart libvirtd

# Enable libvirt to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd

2. Verify the Virtualization Service (libvirtd)

Ensure that the libvirtd service is active and running. This service is essential for managing virtual machines.

# Check the status of libvirtd
sudo systemctl status libvirtd

If it's not running, you can start and enable it:

# Start libvirtd if it's not running
sudo systemctl start libvirtd

# Enable it to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd

3. Check Virtualization Status

Verify that the system supports virtualization (i.e., KVM or QEMU) and that the virtualization features are enabled.

# Check for hardware virtualization support
sudo virt-host-validate

The command should confirm that virtualization features like KVM, CPU support, and IOMMU are available. If any of these are missing, you might need to enable them in your BIOS (e.g., Intel VT-x or AMD-V).
4. Access Virtualization in Cockpit

After installing the necessary packages and ensuring that services are running:

    Open your Cockpit interface by going to https://<your-server-ip>:9090.
    You should now see a "Virtual Machines" option in the Cockpit console on the left side.
    If you donâ€™t see the option yet, try refreshing the browser or logging out and back in again.

5. Enable Firewall Rules for Virtualization (If Required)

If you have a firewall enabled on your system, ensure the required ports for Cockpit and virtualization are open.

# Open ports for Cockpit (9090)
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9090/tcp --permanent

# Open libvirt port (16509) for remote management of VMs
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=16509/tcp --permanent

# Reload the firewall to apply changes
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

6. Verify Cockpit Version

Make sure you're using an updated version of Cockpit and Cockpit Machines. Run the following to check the installed versions:

# Check the Cockpit version
cockpit --version

# Check the Cockpit Machines version
yum info cockpit-machines

7. Reboot the System

If all else fails, reboot the system to ensure all configurations and services are applied properly.

sudo reboot
